Coda2-bash-mode
===============

Bash syntax mode for Coda 2.

I found that this gave me enough visual separation to start making sense of bash scripts in Coda 2.

To install bash.mode for Coda 2
- Open the Finder and select the'Go to Folder' option in the 'Go' menu (or hit command + shift + G)
- Paste the path '~/Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Modes' into the ext box and hite enter, this will take you to the Coda 2 modes folder
- Copy or move the bash.mode package into the Coda 2 modes folder
- Launch or Restart Coda 2
